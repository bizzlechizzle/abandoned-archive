The district renamed the building in 1978 to honor Charlotte Kenyon, a beloved teacher and principal who guided Forks students for more than four decades, keeping music, art, and community events rooted in the brick halls along Main Street.\n\nWhen the elementary grades shifted to a new facility in 2002, the landmark beside the Chenango River fell quiet. Explorers still find the auditorium stage dressed for assemblies, cafeteria murals celebrating the region's canal and rail heritage, and stacks of chairs left in basement classrooms - scenes documented by urban explorers in the mid-2010s.\n\nRedevelopment plans have surfaced repeatedly, from community center concepts to a 2022 proposal for workforce housing, yet water intrusion, asbestos abatement, and financing hurdles continue to stall construction. Until a viable reuse secures funding, Charlotte Kenyon Elementary remains a time capsule for the village and alumni advocating for its revival.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10\">\u003C/div>\n\n{(() => {\n  const galleryImages = Array.isArray(frontmatter.galleryImages)\n    ? frontmatter.galleryImages\n    : [];\n  const primaryImages = galleryImages.filter(image => !image?.historical);\n  const historicalImages = galleryImages.filter(image => image?.historical);\n\n  return (\n    \u003C>\n      {primaryImages.length > 0 && (\n        \u003CGalleryLightbox\n          galleryId=\"charlotte-kenyon-elementary\"\n          images={primaryImages}\n        />\n      )}\n\n      {historicalImages.length > 0 && (\n        \u003Csection className=\"historical-gallery\">\n          \u003Cp className=\"historical-gallery__label\">Historical images\u003C/p>\n          \u003CGalleryLightbox\n            galleryId=\"charlotte-kenyon-elementary\"\n            images={historicalImages}\n            class=\"gallery gallery--two historical-gallery__grid\"\n          />\n        \u003C/section>\n      )}\n    \u003C/>\n  );\n})()}\n\n## Sources\n\n- [WBNG - You Ask, We Answer: What are the latest plans for the old Charlotte Kenyon Elementary School?](https://www.wbng.com/2022/06/02/you-ask-we-answer-what-are-latest-plans-old-charlotte-kenyon-elementary-school/)\n- [Traversing Travy - Exploring Charlotte Kenyon Elementary School](https://traversingtravy.com/2015/09/17/exploring-charlotte-kenyon-elementary-school/)\n- [Press & Sun-Bulletin - Charlotte L.

The congregation moved into a purpose-built sanctuary in 1881, raising the white frame building along the ridge between Rome and Cadis that appears throughout township histories. Membership rolls documented in county directories show a small but steady fellowship supported by pastors trained at Practical Bible College and Baptist Bible College.\n\nNewspaper coverage in The Evening Times chronicled the church's revival meetings, missionary offerings, and Ladies Aid events through the early 1900s, underscoring how the sanctuary doubled as a community gathering place in rural Bradford County. Later ministers such as Richard Rizzi and Richard Curtis maintained those traditions, capturing photographs and local press that preserved the building's role in township life even as attendance waned.\n\nBy the early 2000s the congregation could no longer sustain weekly services, and Cadis Baptist Church officially closed in March 2003. Former members continued to care for the property until time and weather took their toll, and the structure was finally removed in 2021. Today only photographs, aerial surveys, and personal remembrances - including tributes from longtime members like Blair Hanel - recall the simple meetinghouse that anchored the Cadis community for more than a century.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10\">\u003C/div>\n\n{(() => {\n  const galleryImages = Array.isArray(frontmatter.galleryImages)\n    ? frontmatter.galleryImages\n    : [];\n  const

quickly became known as Congregation B'Nai Israel. It rose alongside thriving kosher markets and delis that once lined the corridor, and its twin entrance towers, stained glass, and meticulously numbered pews reflected the optimism of Rochester's north-side Jewish community.\n\nFor decades the sanctuary hosted religious services, fundraisers, and neighborhood meetings, even as families gradually relocated to the suburbs following World War II. By the late twentieth century the congregation had merged elsewhere, yet locals continued to refer to the Joseph Avenue landmark as Temple B'Nai Israel—a name that still appears in community directories and on neighborhood tours. Subsequent church congregations kept the lights on for a time before deferred maintenance took its toll on the plaster, flooring, and balcony railings captured in these photographs.\n\nToday a coalition led by the Joseph Avenue Arts and Culture Alliance is working to stabilize the structure and reimagine it as a performing arts center and heritage hub. The effort has already earned recognition through a William G. Pomeroy Foundation historic marker and documentation on regional heritage registers, ensuring the story of Rochester's oldest surviving purpose-built synagogue remains in public view while plans for revival move forward.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10\">\u003C/div>\n\n{(() => {\n  const galleryImages = Array.isArray(frontmatter.galleryImages)\n    ? frontmatter.galleryImages\n    : [];\n  const primaryImages = galleryImages.filter(image => !image?.historical);\n  const historicalImages = galleryImages.filter(image => image?.historical);\n\n  return (\n    \u003C>\n      {primaryImages.length > 0 && (\n        \u003CGalleryLightbox\n          galleryId=\"congregation-bnai-israel-synagogue\"\n          images={primaryImages}\n        />\n      )}\n\n      {historicalImages.length > 0 && (\n        \u003Csection className=\"historical-gallery\">\n          \u003Cp className=\"historical-gallery__label\">Historical images\u003C/p>\n          \u003CGalleryLightbox\n            galleryId=\"congregation-bnai-israel-synagogue\"\n            images={historicalImages}\n            class=\"gallery gallery--two historical-gallery__grid\"\n          />\n        \u003C/section>\n      )}\n    \u003C/>\n  );\n})()}\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Temple B'Nai Israel - Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/temple-bnai-israel-rochester)\n- [Democrat and Chronicle — Joseph Avenue synagogue's arts center future](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/picture-gallery/news/2022/03/15/joseph-ave-1928-synagogue-future-home-arts-center/1367073002/)\n- [William G.

Luther Church is located in Gleason, Wisconsin. Established in 1907, it is the first Estonian church on record in North America. The land was deeded by Sig and Tena Heineman to a group of immigrants from the Baltic Nations to support their faith. The property was later deeded to Evangelical Martin Luther, where the church gained its name, on July 16th, 1914. This original church is the same structure standing today.\n\nWhen two prominent members of the Church decided to support a new church, almost all activity at the church ceased. It was a core wish of one of the founding fathers that the church always remain a landmark and reminder of Estonian roots in America. Unfortunately, attempts to restore the church have continued since the early 90's and thus far have been unsuccessful.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10\">\u003C/div>\n\n{(() => {\n  const galleryImages = Array.isArray(frontmatter.galleryImages)\n    ? frontmatter.galleryImages\n    : [];\n  const primaryImages = galleryImages.filter(image => !image?.historical);\n  const historicalImages = galleryImages.filter(image => image?.historical);\n\n  return (\n    \u003C>\n      {primaryImages.length > 0 && (\n        \u003CGalleryLightbox\n          galleryId=\"estonian-evangelical-martin-luther-church\"\n          images={primaryImages}\n        />\n      )}\n\n      {historicalImages.length > 0 && (\n        \u003Csection className=\"historical-gallery\">\n          \u003Cp className=\"historical-gallery__label\">Historical images\u003C/p>\n          \u003CGalleryLightbox\n            galleryId=\"estonian-evangelical-martin-luther-church\"\n            images={historicalImages}\n            class=\"gallery gallery--two historical-gallery__grid\"\n          />\n        \u003C/section>\n      )}\n    \u003C/>\n  );\n})()}\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Metsakirik Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/metsakirik/)\n- [Estonian World – Restoring an old Estonian church depends on volunteers and donations](https://estonianworld.com/life/restoring-an-old-estonian-church-depends-on-volunteers-and-donations/)\n- [Vaba Eesti Sõna – The First Estonian Church Built in North America](https://www.vabaeestisona.com/the-first-estonian-church-built-in-north-america/)","src/locations/estonian-evangelical-martin-luther-church.mdx",[598,599],"../assets/images/estonian-evangelical-martin-luther-church/estonian-evangelical-martin-luther-exterior-church.jpg","../assets/images/estonian-evangelical-martin-luther-church/estonian-evangelical-martin-luther-interior-church.jpg","1f59d2daa9175e75","endicott-johnson-fair-play-factory",{"id":601,"data":603,"body":716,"filePath":717,"assetImports":718,"digest":721,"deferredRender":21},{"author":14,"pubDatetime":604,"title":605,"seoTitle":606,"description":607,"seoDescription":608,"featured":20,"draft":20,"state":22,"county":165,"city":609,"region":25,"category":610,"status":253,"built_year":611,"abandoned_year":612,"lastmod":613,"tags":614,"heroImage":615,"heroImageAlt":616,"seoImage":617,"galleryImages":618,"canonicalURL":715},["Date","2016-07-11T07:00:00.000Z"],"Endicott-Johnson Fair Play Factory","Endicott-Johnson Fair Play Factory | Abandoned Upstate","Endicott’s Lost Shoe Factory","Discover the abandoned Endicott-Johnson Fair Play Factory in Endicott, New York, once a Southern Tier shoe powerhouse now standing empty.","endicott","factories",1922,2009,["Date","2025-10-06T14:00:00.000Z"],[610],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_../assets/images/fair-play-factory/endicott-johnson-fair-play-exterior-shoe-factory.jpg","Abandoned Endicott-Johnson Fair Play Factory in Endicott, New York","__ASTRO_IMAGE_../assets/images/fair-play-factory/endicott-johnson-fair-play-interior-room-5.jpg",[619,623,627,631,635,639,643,647,651,655,659,663,667,671,675,679,683,687,691,695,699,703,707,711],{"src":620,"caption":621,"seoCaption":622},"@/assets/images/fair-play-factory/endicott-johnson-fair-play-exterior-shoe-factory.jpg","Fair Play Factory -

EJ Shoes held a prominent position as the nation's leading shoe manufacturer and a significant advocate of welfare capitalism during its heyday.\n\nOfficially opening its doors on Monday, June 4th, 1923, the factory had an intriguing start. An April 1923 article from the News Dispatch reported that, although not fully completed, workers were already engaged in shoemaking within the new facility. Its initial operation aimed to provide employment for 1000 individuals and produce over 7000 pairs of shoes daily.\n\nIn October 2018 the Fair Play Factory met its end when it was demolished to make room for the new headquarters of National Pipe & Plastics.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10\">\u003C/div>\n\n{(() => {\n  const galleryImages = Array.isArray(frontmatter.galleryImages)\n    ? frontmatter.galleryImages\n    : [];\n  const primaryImages = galleryImages.filter(image => !image?.historical);\n  const historicalImages = galleryImages.filter(image => image?.historical);\n\n  return (\n    \u003C>\n      {primaryImages.length > 0 && (\n        \u003CGalleryLightbox\n          galleryId=\"endicott-johnson-fair-play-factory\"\n          images={primaryImages}\n        />\n      )}\n\n      {historicalImages.length > 0 && (\n        \u003Csection className=\"historical-gallery\">\n          \u003Cp className=\"historical-gallery__label\">Historical images\u003C/p>\n          \u003CGalleryLightbox\n            galleryId=\"endicott-johnson-fair-play-factory\"\n            images={historicalImages}\n            class=\"gallery gallery--two historical-gallery__grid\"\n          />\n        \u003C/section>\n      )}\n    \u003C/>\n  );\n})()}\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Gregory Couch – Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company](https://www.gregorycouch.com/endicott-johnson-shoe-company)\n- [We the Story of an Industrial Success (PDF)](https://www.talkinghistory.org/ej/We%20the%20Story%20of%20an%20Industrial%20Success.pdf)\n- [Endicott Visitor Center Facebook – Fair Play Factory](https://www.facebook.com/Endicottvisitorcenter/posts/tbt-endicott-johnson-factory-west/1083568193586668/)\n- [NPR – The Legacy of George F.

Winkelman Co. Inc. is an abandoned warehouse complex on the east side of Syracuse, New York. Owned and operated by Dwight W. Winkelman, the company originated in Chicago in 1924 before relocating to New York in 1930 for Adirondack construction projects. Winkelman established the Syracuse office in 1937 to oversee heavy civil work across the region.\n\nSpecializing in large-scale infrastructure, the company built airports, highways, military bases, and industrial facilities. By 1988 the site was listed as an inactive hazardous waste area after vandals ruptured transformers and released PCB-laden oil onto the property—an event that marked the start of decades-long abandonment and tax delinquency for the parcel.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10\">\u003C/div>\n\n{(() => {\n  const galleryImages = Array.isArray(frontmatter.galleryImages)\n    ?

Amphitheater-style bleachers wrapped the 3/8-mile oval when it opened in 1991, and the new surface quickly drew comparisons to national short tracks. Within a year the promoters converted the clay into asphalt, making I-94 Minnesota's first paved speedway and a regional destination for touring series.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and early 2000s the oval hosted NASCAR Midwest Series dates, ASA Midwest Tour stops, ARTGO late models, and hometown divisions. Ownership changes in 2009 brought another dramatic shift: the track reclaimed the Speedway name, tore out the asphalt, and went back to a clay surface. The gambit never regained its former crowds; by the end of that same season the lights went dark for good and the facility slipped into disrepair.\n\nToday the painted walls, sponsor boards, and Miller Lite scoreboard fade in the prairie sun, while grass pushes through the fractured turns and aluminum planks. Shuttered concession stands, empty flag and scoring towers, and wind-worn grandstands now overlook a silent oval that once echoed each Saturday night.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10\">\u003C/div>\n\n{(()

in Jamesville, New York, was a semi-private golf course established in 1923. It featured an 18-hole layout designed by Seymour Dunn, spanning 6,550 yards with a par of 71. Despite its amenities like a driving range, snack bar, and clubhouse lounges, the club faced a sharp decline in membership that culminated in its closure. A tax dispute with the city of Syracuse and an exodus of members—from 350 golfers to none by 2013—left the course abandoned.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10\">\u003C/div>\n\n{(() => {\n  const

1896. Renowned for its award-winning butter, the cooperative regularly collected ribbons at county fairs and the Minnesota State Fair. After serving the community for two decades, a fire razed the building on July 7, 1920.\n\nRemarkably, the creamery was rebuilt in fewer than 90 days. The new structure boasted an upstairs auditorium that hosted local elections and community events, plus on-site accommodations for the butter makers.

House is an abandoned farm in Stearns County, Minnesota. In 1859, Henry Landwehr ventured to St. Augusta township, where he acquired 160 acres and built a yellow brick farmhouse. The Landwehr legacy endured through successive generations, with Landwehr men and their families committing their lives to the farm. This longstanding tradition concluded with the passing of Roman Landwehr on June 14th, 2014.\n\nSubsequently, his wife Angie reached out to the Stearns History Museum, seeking recognition for the farm as a century farm — a title bestowed upon farm families that have maintained ownership of at least 50 acres continuously for 100 years or more.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10\">\u003C/div>\n\n{(() => {\n

The psychiatric facility ceased operations under state management in 1974, remaining shuttered for decades.\n\nIn 2017, the complex underwent a partial restoration and was repurposed into a unique and historic hotel.

Evidently, this house, likely the owner's childhood home, has remained vacant since their parents passed away.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10\">\u003C/div>\n\n{(() => {\n  const galleryImages = Array.isArray(frontmatter.galleryImages)\n    ? frontmatter.galleryImages\n    : [];\n  const primaryImages = galleryImages.filter(image => !image?.historical);\n  const historicalImages = galleryImages.filter(image => image?.historical);\n\n  return (\n    \u003C>\n      {primaryImages.length > 0 && (\n        \u003CGalleryLightbox\n          galleryId=\"the-cadillac-house\"\n          images={primaryImages}\n        />\n      )}\n\n      {historicalImages.length > 0 && (\n        \u003Csection className=\"historical-gallery\">\n          \u003Cp className=\"historical-gallery__label\">Historical images\u003C/p>\n          \u003CGalleryLightbox\n            galleryId=\"the-cadillac-house\"\n            images={historicalImages}\n            class=\"gallery gallery--two historical-gallery__grid\"\n          />\n        \u003C/section>\n      )} \n    \u003C/>\n  );\n})()}\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Cornell University Library - NY Aerial Photographs](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/?f%5Bcollection_tesim%5D%5B%5D=New+York+State+Aerial+Photographs&f%5Blocation_facet_tesim%5D%5B%5D=Seneca+County+%28N.Y.%29&search_field=all_fields)\n- [Vintage Aerial - Seneca County, NY](https://vintageaerial.com/photos/new-york/seneca)\n- [Streetview - Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Seneca+County,+NY/@42.7827976,-76.7836615)\n- [Facebook Post - Abandoned Upstate](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1Ccua8t7TS/)\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-12\">\u003C/div>","src/locations/the-cadillac-house.mdx",[1362,1363],"../assets/images/the-cadillac-house/cadillac-house-exterior-overgrown-porch.jpg","../assets/images/the-cadillac-house/cadillac-house-interior-abandoned-1971-cadillac-eldorado-convertible.jpg","7d40400687fa0ff9","the-coliseum",{"id":1365,"data":1367,"body":1441,"filePath":1442,"assetImports":1443,"digest":1446,"deferredRender":21},{"author":14,"pubDatetime":1368,"title":1369,"seoTitle":1370,"description":1371,"seoDescription":1372,"featured":20,"draft":20,"state":22,"county":1373,"city":1374,"region":25,"category":890,"status":27,"built_year":1375,"abandoned_year":1376,"lastmod":1377,"tags":1378,"heroImage":1380,"heroImageAlt":1381,"seoImage":1382,"galleryImages":1383,"canonicalURL":1440},["Date","2022-07-09T06:59:00.000Z"],"The Coliseum","The Coliseum - Abandoned Roller Skating Rink - Ceres, New York","Steam Powerhouse Turned Roller Rink","The Coliseum is an abandoned roller rink in Ceres, New York.

Built in 1956, the motel boasts a semi-unique detached layout. During the 1960s and 1970s, it operated as the Highlander Motor Hotel. In its most recent years, the motel functioned under both the names Vista Heights Inn and the Red Roof brand. While the exact closing date remains unknown, online reviews show a decline after 2016, with a noteworthy absence of positive reviews beyond 2010.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10\">\u003C/div>\n\n{(() =>
